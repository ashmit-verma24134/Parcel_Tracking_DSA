# Parcel_Tracking_DSA
 Parcel Tracking System – Priority-Based Stack Using Linked Lists
Description:

This C-based project implements a Parcel Tracking System using a stack data structure managed through a singly linked list. Each parcel is assigned 
a priority level (1–3), and the system allows users to perform various operations like adding parcels, dispatching the latest one, displaying parcel lists, searching
by tracking ID, and counting parcels by priority.

It showcases my ability to manage dynamic memory, implement data structures manually (without STL), and design interactive, menu-driven applications in C.

Features:

Add new parcels with priority and details

Dispatch parcels in LIFO order (based on stack logic)

Display all parcels with tracking information

Search parcels by tracking ID

Count parcels based on priority

Efficient memory management and safe exit

Technologies Used:

C Language

Linked Lists

Dynamic Memory Allocation

Menu-driven CLI Interface

Highlights:

Demonstrates strong foundational knowledge in data structures and memory handling.

Designed for performance and user clarity within a terminal-based environment.
